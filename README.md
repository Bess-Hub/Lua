# Learning Lua

After going through the Fundamentals I decided to start making some games, before leveling-up and using LUA to add graphics I decided to text my creativity to create a game, so game.lua is my first complete game.

# Game.lua

This is a simple escape the room game. To play use Codespace and no looking through the code before cracking it, hun?!

In the Codespace Terminal run:

```
lua game.lua
```

If the game does not start you need to set the Codespace with the following code:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install lua5.3
```

Now the game should run:

```
lua game.lua
```
