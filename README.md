# Learning Lua

After going through the Fundamentals I decided to start making some games, before leveling-up and using LUA to add graphics I decided to text my creativity to create a game, so game.lua is my first complete game.

# Game.lua

This is a simple escape the room game. To play use Codespace and no looking through the code before cracking it, hun?!

In the Codespace Terminal run:

```
lua game.lua
```

If the game does not start you need to set the Codespace with the following code:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install lua5.3
```

Now the game should run:

```
lua game.lua
```
# Main.lua

Main.lua is a simple maritime geography quizz I have made on October 3rd 2024. Since I will be studying for ICS Exam I need to improve my knowledge of relevant maritime geography.

For Main.lua you will need to run with LOVE2D.

1. Downdload Main.lua and map.png from this repository

2. Add them to a folder

3. Download LOVE2D

4. If on MacBook simply drag the folder to LOVE2D icon
