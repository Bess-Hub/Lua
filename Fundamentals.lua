<!-- Let's take a look at a programming language developed by my _paisano_. We are talking about LUA! -->
<!-- Easier than Python, faster than many languages. Interacts great with C codes and it is great to embed in other applications like WoW and Roblox -->
<!-- So if you are like me and love games, get over here! -->

<!-- Create a variable -->
local var1 = "Hello Earth!"
<!-- Haha! Earth because LUA... :) Now seriously, declaring the variable local is an option, if not declared it will be considered global -->
<!-- What does this mean? That I will see tomorrow and update this file -->

<!-- For today, let's just leave the option to print it, just like in Python -->
print(var1)
