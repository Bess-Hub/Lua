-- Let's take a look at a programming language developed by my _paisano_. We are talking about LUA! --
-- Easier than Python, faster than many languages. Interacts great with C codes and it is great to embed in other applications like WoW and Roblox --
-- So if you are like me and love games, get over here! --

-- Create a variable --
local var1 = "Hello Earth!"
local var2 = 384,400
-- Haha! Earth because LUA... :) Now seriously, declaring the variable local is an option, if not declared it will be considered global --
-- What does this mean? That I will see tomorrow and update this file --

-- For today, let's just leave the option to print it, just like in Python --
print(var1)

-- Or we could print it like this: --
io.write(var1, " We are ", var2, " thousand kilometers away!", "\n", " That is a big ", type(var2), "!")
